# ss-upgrader

This command line tool is designed to help with the SilverStripe ugrade from classes that didn't use namespace to the latest namespaced classes (i.e. to version 4.x). This could also work for earlier version 2.* but that depends on how you architectured your application

## Installation
At the command line enter:  
`composer global require hilmak01/ss-upgrader`
